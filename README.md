### Project Requirements
#### Minigames:
- [ ] Reaction Time: tests your reaction time by seeing how quickly you can click a button after the screen changes color.
- [ ] Aim Trainer: times how long it takes you to click 30 targests that randomly appear on the screen.
- [ ] Chimp Test: click the boxes in numerically increasing order. After you click the first box the numbers dissapear. 
- [ ] Visual Memory: a grid of squares is shown where some of the squares are white and some are not. Then the white squares become the same color as the other squares. The user must click only the squares which were white.
- [ ]  Typing: times how long it takes the user to type out a given paragraph with no mistakes allowed.
- [ ] Number Memory: users must recall an ever increasing number of digits.
- [ ] Verbal Memory: users must mark a word as "seen" or "new", 3 strikes and your out. 
- [ ] Custom Minigame: TBD...
